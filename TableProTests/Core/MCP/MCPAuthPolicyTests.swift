//  The protocol is stateless, so an approval can no longer hang off a session id: it is keyed on
//  the token that earned it and expires on its own. A second token inherits nothing, and revoking
//  a token drops the approvals it was carrying. Scope is enforced here too, not only in the
//  settings UI: an anonymous caller may not write and may not administer, whatever scopes it
//  claims to hold, and a refusal names the missing scope back to the client (RFC 6750
//  `insufficient_scope`).
