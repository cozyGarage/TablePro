# Connection handling

Last audited: 2026-08-20

TablePro is a connection engine before it is a grid. This document records what
the connection layer actually does today, what is proven, what is known to be
wrong, and what has never been exercised. Every claim below was read out of the
source at the audit date. Status terms match [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md):
**implemented** means the code and unit tests exist, **integrated** means every
production entry point uses it, **release-verified** means a deterministic
real-service test proves it.

## The layers

A connection is assembled in one direction, and every surface uses the same path.

```
saved connection
   │
   ├─ tablepro-transport   resolve secrets, build ConnectOptions,
   │                       resolve the SSH chain, open the tunnel,
   │                       set the service endpoint
   │
   ├─ driver.connect()     choose the wire transport, negotiate TLS,
   │                       authenticate, open the pool
   │
   └─ PolicyGuard          classify, evaluate, approve, mask, audit
```

Two ideas carry most of the security weight:

- **Dial address and service identity are separate.** `ConnectOptions.host` is
  where bytes go. `service_endpoint` is who the server must prove it is. A
  tunnel rewrites the first and never the second, so `VerifyFull` through SSH
  still checks the certificate against the real database hostname. See
  `ConnectOptions::service_address` and `ConnectOptions::transport`.
- **Verifying connections prefer a Unix socket over a local TCP port.** When the
  TLS mode verifies certificates and the driver supplies a socket name, the SSH
  chain forwards to a private directory (mode `0700`) instead of a loopback
  port. Nothing else on the machine can reach the forwarded database, and the
  TLS server name cannot be confused with `127.0.0.1`.
- **Local and forwarded sockets are different transports.** A saved PostgreSQL
  connection may name a local socket directory directly. Local sockets reject
  SSH and TLS, while an SSH-created socket retains the remote service identity
  required by certificate verification.

## Transport support by driver

| Driver | TCP | Unix socket | HTTP(S) | TLS modes honoured | Custom CA | Client cert | Connect timeout |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | yes | direct local and SSH-forwarded | n/a | all five on TCP; disabled locally | yes | no | pool acquire only |
| MySQL | yes | no | n/a | all five | yes | no | pool acquire only |
| SQL Server | yes | no | n/a | Disabled / encrypt / verify (CA and Full identical) | no | no | 5 s |
| SQLite | n/a | n/a (local file) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | pool acquire only |
| ClickHouse | n/a | no | yes | Disabled / encrypt / verify (CA and Full identical) | yes | no | 5 s probe |
| Redis | yes | no | n/a | Disabled / encrypt / verify (CA and Full identical) | yes | no | 5 s |
| MongoDB | yes | no | n/a | Disabled / encrypt / verify (CA and Full identical) | yes | no | 5 s |
| DuckDB | n/a | n/a (local file) | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Oracle | yes | no | n/a | not applied | no | no | 15 s (does not compile, see below) |

"Pool acquire only" means the driver bounds how long it waits for a pooled
connection but does not bound the initial TCP or TLS handshake.

## What is release-verified

Only PostgreSQL, and only through the fixture in
`tests/fixtures/postgres-release`. That fixture proves, against a real server:

- `VerifyFull` succeeds against the certificate hostname and fails against a
  hostname outside the certificate.
- `VerifyCa` and `VerifyFull` both reject an unknown certificate authority.
- A TCP-forwarded `VerifyFull` never verifies the local dial address.
- A verifying session through SSH forwards over a private Unix socket and uses
  the original database hostname.
- An SSH tunnel reaches a database with no published port.
- Cutting the database path and cutting the bastion path both fail queries, and
  a fresh connection recovers in each case.
- The shared transport carries a tunnelled session for the GUI and the agent
  daemon identically, and fails closed when the bastion is unreachable.

Everything else in the table above is implemented and, at best, covered by
container integration tests that connect in plaintext.

## Known problems

Confirmed by reading the source. Ordered by severity.

### 1. MongoDB silently ignores the TLS setting — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-19.** The driver now sets the client's TLS options from the
selected mode and honours a saved certificate authority. Because the rustls
backend has no CA-only mode, `VerifyCa` verifies the hostname as well, which is
stricter than requested and never weaker. The defect was reproduced first: a
`VerifyFull` connection to a TLS-only server failed with `unexpected end of
file`, proving the client was speaking plaintext. Release-verified by the
driver TLS tier.

### 2. Redis cannot use TLS at all, and defaults to trying — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-19.** The dependency now enables `tls-rustls`, a verifying
mode reads the connection's certificate authority through `build_with_tls`, and
an encrypt-only mode uses the client's `#insecure` form. The defect was
reproduced first against a TLS-only server: `can't connect with TLS, the feature
is not enabled`. Release-verified by the driver TLS tier. The connect attempt is
now bounded at five seconds as well.

### 3. A private certificate authority is unusable on every driver — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-19.** `SavedConnection` now carries `tls_root_cert`, the
connect dialog exposes it whenever the selected mode verifies certificates, and
`connect_options_for` threads it into `TlsConfig.root_cert`. Release-verified
against the fixture: a saved connection naming the fixture authority verifies a
privately issued certificate, one naming an unrelated authority is refused, one
naming none fails against the system trust store, and an encrypt-only mode
ignores the setting. PostgreSQL and MySQL consume the field; SQL Server,
ClickHouse, Redis, and MongoDB still ignore it, which is item 5 below.

### 4. `TlsConfig` advertises three capabilities that nothing implements

`client_cert`, `client_key`, and `pinned_fingerprint` are defined, serialized,
and read by no driver. Mutual TLS and certificate pinning do not exist. A field
that is stored and ignored is worse than an absent one, because a saved file can
carry a setting the user believes is in force.

### 5. TLS modes collapse on SQL Server

**ClickHouse closed on 2026-08-19.** It now builds its own HTTP connector, so
Prefer and Require encrypt without verifying, Verify Ca and Verify Full check
the chain, and a saved certificate authority is honoured. Both halves of the
defect were reproduced first: `VerifyFull` with the fixture authority failed
because the driver could only use the bundled root store, and `Require` failed
too, because asking for encrypt-only silently got full verification against
roots that do not know a private certificate.

SQL Server still maps Verify Ca and Verify Full to the same configuration and
has no authority setting, so a privately issued certificate cannot be trusted
there. On ClickHouse, MongoDB, and Redis the rustls backend offers no CA-only
mode, so Verify Ca verifies the hostname as well; that is stricter than
requested, never weaker, and is documented in each driver.

### 6. No connect timeout on the SSH path or on Oracle — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-19.** The SSH handshake is bounded at ten seconds and
authentication at twenty, each failing with an error that names the host and
port. Oracle is bounded at fifteen seconds, MongoDB and Redis at five. The SSH
bound has a sandbox regression test that connects to a listener which completes
the TCP handshake and then never sends a banner; a refused port returns
instantly and proves nothing.

### 7. Two rustls providers left the default ambiguous — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-19.** The static drivers pull in both `ring` (MySQL, SQL
Server, MongoDB) and `aws-lc-rs` (ClickHouse), so rustls could not choose a
process-wide crypto provider. Any library that built a `ClientConfig` without
naming one panicked at connect time: MySQL `Verify Ca` panicked in the real
application, because the GUI links every driver. The condition predates the
ClickHouse work and had never been visible, since no test binary linked both
families until the driver TLS tier did.

Every composition root now calls `install_crypto_provider` before connecting:
the GUI, the agent daemon, and each test binary that links more than one driver.
A driver that names its own provider, as ClickHouse now does, is unaffected
either way.

### 8. The Oracle driver does not compile under its own feature

`cargo check -p tablepro-driver-oracle --features odpi` fails with three errors
against `oracle` 0.6.3: `Statement::row_count` now returns a `Result` and is
cast directly to `u64` in two places, and `SqlValue` no longer implements
`FromSql`, which the row reader depends on. The driver is registered only when
the feature is on, so nothing catches this: the default build compiles a stub
that returns `Unsupported`. Every claim that Oracle works "with Instant Client"
is therefore untested and currently false. The value-mapping error cannot be
fixed blind; it needs a real Oracle to verify against. A host
that accepts a connection and then goes silent — a dropped packet filter, a
half-open NAT entry, a hung bastion — leaves the attempt hanging on whatever the
underlying library defaults to. The GUI keeps this off the main thread, so the
window stays responsive, but the connection attempt itself may never resolve.
The existing regression tests use a refused port, which returns immediately and
does not exercise this path.

### 7. No local Unix socket connections — fixed

**Closed on 2026-08-20 for PostgreSQL.** Saved records carry an optional socket
directory without a schema-version bump. The GTK form exposes Network and Unix
socket endpoints only for capable drivers, defaults to `/run/postgresql`, and
keeps the port as the `.s.PGSQL.<port>` selector. Transport validation rejects
relative paths, non-socket targets, TLS, SSH, and unsupported drivers. GUI and
agentd both assemble the same `ConnectOptions`; a disposable real PostgreSQL
socket fixture covers query, write, cancellation, close, and reconnect.

### 8. The agent daemon and the GUI recover differently

The GUI runs a monitor that pings every 30 seconds and reconnects with backoff
from 5 to 60 seconds. The agent daemon's session cache validates with a ping on
use and reconnects lazily, with no monitor and no backoff. A tool call that
arrives during an outage retries as fast as the caller retries, bounded only by
the MCP rate limiter.

## Potential problems

Not confirmed. Listed so they are not rediscovered as surprises.

- **Connection pool identity.** PostgreSQL opens a four-connection pool plus a
  one-connection cancellation pool. Session state set on one pooled connection
  (`SET`, temporary tables, advisory locks, `search_path`) is not guaranteed to
  be visible to the next query. Anything that assumes session continuity across
  two calls may be relying on luck.
- **Tunnel lifetime versus pool lifetime.** The tunnel is held beside the
  connection and dropped with it. If a pool reconnects internally after the
  tunnel is gone, the failure mode has not been characterised.
- **IPv6 and bracketed literals.** Host strings are formatted into URLs by the
  ClickHouse, Redis, and MongoDB drivers without bracketing. An IPv6 literal
  will almost certainly produce a malformed URL.
- **Hostname handling in the SSH chain.** Known-host learning is keyed on host
  and port. Whether a chain that reaches the same host through different jumps
  is treated consistently has not been examined.
- **Credential exposure in URLs.** Redis, MongoDB, and ClickHouse place the
  password in a URL string. Those strings are not logged today, but a future
  error path that includes the URL would leak the secret.
- **Kerberos and TLS interaction on SQL Server.** Integrated authentication runs
  on a blocking task with its own timeout. Its behaviour under a verifying TLS
  mode is untested.

## Untested areas

Ordered by how much risk the gap carries.

| Area | Current coverage |
|---|---|
| TLS on SQL Server | none — the container tests connect in plaintext |
| TLS on Oracle | none |
| Redis, MongoDB, DuckDB, Oracle, SQLite | no integration test file at all |
| SSH jump chains of more than one hop | none — the fixture has a single bastion |
| SSH password and passphrase authentication | none — every test uses an unencrypted private key |
| Unreachable-but-silent hosts | none — tests use refused ports, which return immediately |
| Custom certificate authority from a saved connection | assembly and driver fixture coverage; installed GTK selection remains untested |
| Client certificates and pinned fingerprints | not implemented |
| Reconnect on any driver but PostgreSQL | none |
| The Oracle driver under its `odpi` feature | does not compile |
| Cancellation on any driver but PostgreSQL | none |
| Concurrent connections to the same host over one tunnel | none |
| IPv6 literals on any driver | none |

## Recommended order

Fixing the silent failures first, then the missing capability, then the coverage
that would have caught both.

1. ~~**Root certificate on saved connections.**~~ Done on 2026-08-19.
2. ~~**MongoDB TLS.**~~ Done on 2026-08-19.
3. ~~**Redis TLS.**~~ Done on 2026-08-19.
4. **Connect timeouts.** Bound the SSH handshake and Oracle; MongoDB and Redis
   are now bounded at five seconds. Add a fixture case that black-holes packets
   rather than refusing them.
5. **Remove or implement the dead TLS fields.** `client_cert`, `client_key`, and
   `pinned_fingerprint` should either work or not exist.
6. ~~**Local Unix socket connections.**~~ Done for PostgreSQL on 2026-08-20.
7. **A TLS fixture per network driver.** The PostgreSQL fixture is the model.
   Until MySQL, SQL Server, and ClickHouse have one, their TLS behaviour is
   asserted only by reading the code — which is how items 1, 2, and 5 survived.
