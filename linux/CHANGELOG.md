# Changelog: TablePro Linux

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- PostgreSQL views appear in the sidebar as read-only objects, listed through the same policy and timeout path as tables
- Saved connections can name a certificate authority, so a server whose certificate is issued privately can be verified with Verify Ca or Verify Full
- Policy crate with AST SQL classification, PolicyGuard, blast-radius rewrite, column masking, and policy.toml. Statements that read host files, run a program, or send SQL to another server are treated as administrative, so an agent is refused and a read-only connection denies them
- Environment field on saved connections (Local / Dev / Staging / Prod)
- Hash-chained audit journal at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tablepro/audit.jsonl`
- Interactive `Connection::begin` transactions (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- TLS modes including VerifyFull default for new TLS connections, with certificate hostname and authority failures reported as TLS errors
- MCP bridge (interactive-app loopback HTTP plus on-demand agentd stdio) with scoped tokens and rate limiting, speaking the 2026-07-28 protocol revision while still accepting the two before it, and refusing to listen anywhere but the loopback interface
- Agents can read a table's columns, keys and indexes, count its rows exactly, and page through it, each through the same policy, allowlist and audit checks as any other tool and none of them needing write access
- Headless on-demand `tablepro-agentd` with required `--policy`, issuing read-only tokens by default, with an optional expiry and a way to write the token to an owner-only file instead of the terminal
- GTK approval dialog for policy `RequireApproval` decisions
- Server activity SQL templates (sessions, locks, long-running, replication), with the views an engine cannot answer shown as disabled and explained rather than failing when clicked
- Example policy file and MSSQL in AppStream metainfo
- SSH jump-host chains via nested `ssh.jump` in saved connections and `SshTunnel::open_chain`
- Keyset pagination helper for browse Next past the OFFSET threshold when primary keys are known
- Current-page CSV export with explicit non-snapshot semantics, written so another program never reads a half-finished file
- EXPLAIN plan dialog from the SQL editor and main menu
- Server version cached on connect and shown in the window subtitle
- ClickHouse, Redis, DuckDB, and MongoDB drivers; Oracle remains excluded until its optional implementation and fixture work
- Preferences → MCP token pairing (libsecret + loopback endpoint)
- Multi-window via New Window, with each window connecting on its own
- Saved connections can be put in a group, tagged, and starred as favourites, searched by any of those or by driver, and created by pasting a connection URL, whose password goes to the keyring rather than to disk
- Flathub submission notes and screenshot capture guide
- Rust file-size guardrail in preflight: soft 1200 / hard 1800 lines, with ratchet ceilings in `file-size-baselines.txt`
- Driver maturity labels in the Connect dialog (Experimental subtitle for Redis, MongoDB, DuckDB, and Oracle)
- Driver maturity matrix in `docs/driver-maturity.md`
- Drivers declare whether they can report indexes and foreign keys, so an engine that has none is no longer indistinguishable from a table that has none
- Windows integrated authentication for SQL Server through the current Kerberos ticket cache
- Principal-aware GUI approval routing with fail-closed behavior when no active window exists
- Explicit administrative SQL classification for PostgreSQL backend-control functions and MySQL KILL
- Weekly and manually dispatched full-workspace Clippy on current stable Rust, alongside the Rust 1.93 MSRV gate
- Arch/Omarchy Rust toolchain guidance and a traceable upstream Linux sync log
- Installed GTK safety checks for approval dismissal, approve-once scope, and unavailable audit storage
- Deterministic PostgreSQL release checks for TLS hostname and authority verification, tunnelled access, read-only denial, rollback, blocking locks, and reconnect
- Verify Full for PostgreSQL over SSH, using the original database hostname for certificate checks
- Named `:parameter` placeholders in the SQL editor, with a per-value type choice, sent to the database as bound parameters. Statement splitting and placeholder scanning follow the connected engine's own quoting, so a PostgreSQL function body is run whole and a MySQL `#` comment hides nothing but itself
- Schema-aware editor completion that offers tables after FROM and JOIN, and the columns of the tables in the statement, including through table aliases
- Saved query favorites in `favorites.json`, saved with Ctrl+D
- Open Quickly (Ctrl+P) over favorites, open tabs, and saved connections
- Direct PostgreSQL Unix-socket connections shared by GUI and agentd, with saved-path compatibility and a real socket fixture
- Required GTK connection-isolation smoke plus a daily five-attempt retry-free soak workflow
- Internal Arch RC packaging from an immutable commit archive and verified checksum
- Screen readers now announce the browse toolbar's insert-row button by name
- Installed GTK checks that a connection switch gates pending row edits and that a browse tab reads the connection it was reopened against
- Each window holds its own database connection, so several databases can be open at the same time in separate windows

### Changed

- Preferences no longer offers an Admin MCP token. That option did not grant extra tools or bypass policy, and a stored Admin token still authenticates as read and write.
- Saving several row edits at once writes them in primary-key order, so two windows saving overlapping rows cannot deadlock against each other and a failed save reports the same row every time
- Stop is offered for the engines that can actually abort a statement, because the policy layer no longer hides a driver's cancellation support
- A cell edit is discarded with an explanation if the row moved out from under the editor, instead of being written to whichever row took its place
- Copy row as INSERT leaves out generated columns, which the database always rejects, and escapes a value the way the connected engine reads it, so a row holding a backslash copies as data rather than as SQL
- Stop and the query timeout now abort the running statement on MySQL, ClickHouse and SQLite, so the statement stops in the database and the session can keep writing afterwards
- A cancelled or timed-out SQL Server statement now reports that its outcome is unknown and closes the connection, instead of leaving every later query on that connection waiting forever
- SQLite results show the value of a computed column instead of a blank cell, so counts, aggregates and literal expressions read correctly, and a browse tab shows its total row count
- Browsing, row counts, structure reads, DDL, saving row edits, server activity, EXPLAIN and connecting all honour the configured query timeout instead of running without limit
- MSSQL uses native TLS and keeps its Kerberos service identity when SSH forwards the socket through localhost
- Workspace crates declare AGPL-3.0-or-later; cargo-deny allows that license and documents the rsa Marvin advisory ignore
- Linux UI and DDL modules split by domain: browse tab, grid, editor, app workspace helpers, and `sql_ddl` are directories of focused files instead of multi-thousand-line units
- Read-only is enforced by policy classification (data-modifying CTEs blocked)
- DatabaseService exposes only policy-gated connection handles
- Roadmap and production audit rewritten to match the governed data-plane plan
- Arbitrary SQL query soft row cap raised to 1,000,000 (truncated flag still set); browse pagination remains uncapped by that constant
- Agentd approval strategies are deny (default) or interactive TTY; automatic approval is test-only
- DuckDB driver is an optional `duckdb` Cargo feature (bundled build is large)
- Oracle appears in the driver list only when built with `--features odpi`
- Linux CI runs a non-GTK preflight job before the full GTK checks; local `./scripts/preflight.sh` mirrors that gate
- Policy evaluation takes the resolved connection EnvPolicy once; connection overrides no longer re-run evaluate
- Connect dialog TLS control is a mode picker (Disabled / Prefer / Require / Verify CA / Verify Full), defaulting to Verify Full for network drivers
- Local and development human writes require audit by default; best-effort unaudited writes require an explicit policy setting
- PostgreSQL query timeout and cancellation now wait within bounded deadlines for server confirmation before returning to GTK or MCP callers
- Connection changes validate a candidate before exclusively replacing the old workspace; failed candidates and failed saves keep the old connection active
- PostgreSQL browse pages resolve primary-key ordering before the first row fetch and append PK tie-breakers to user sorts
- Public package metadata names only drivers that are actually shipped

### Fixed

- A denied statement or dismissed approval is refused if that denial cannot be written to the audit journal
- The last open connection is reopened when the app starts. If it cannot connect, its tabs stay with that connection instead of attaching to another database
- Saved connection rows show the environment as a colour
- Measuring how many rows an UPDATE or DELETE would touch now uses the same timeout and cancellation as the write itself, instead of running an unbounded count first
- Reading a table's indexes and foreign keys now stops at the query timeout, and a failed read no longer pretends the table has none
- Structure tabs reopen after a reconnect, and the saved workspace no longer points at the wrong tab when a draft was skipped
- Closing the server activity dialog, or starting another activity query, stops the one that was still running
- Agent table lists and column descriptions now stop at the query timeout, reject invalid names, and are refused when audit storage is unavailable
- A policy file that cannot be read is no longer treated as an empty policy. Agent access stays off until the file can be loaded, and reopening Preferences keeps the previous policy instead of replacing it
- An empty mask list no longer turns off result masking. Use the environment setting that disables agent masking if that is what you want
- Query history export is written so another program never reads a half-finished file
- Setting a cell to NULL or deleting a row from the grid is discarded if the row moved, instead of changing whichever row took its place
- Switching connections no longer clears the previous connection's saved tabs
- A browse page or SQL run that finishes late no longer replaces a newer page or result
- Unsaved edits in one window no longer block or discard edits in another window
- Workspace changes are coalesced off the GTK thread, flushed before the last window closes, and reported instead of silently lost when persistence fails
- Saved connections, favorites, organization data, and MCP tokens preserve valid concurrent updates across processes and refuse malformed, oversized, symlinked, or permissively stored input where applicable
- MCP deadlines cover connection lookup, acquisition, metadata, preview execution, and rollback cleanup, with timed-out or uncertain guarded operations receiving terminal audit outcomes
- The headless agent refreshes cached sessions when saved transport settings change, bounds health checks and connection attempts, and keeps SSH tunnels alive only while issued connections still use them
- Secret Service failures are reported instead of being treated as empty database passwords, while SQLite and DuckDB connections do not require Secret Service
- The headless agent daemon reuses one database session per connection instead of opening a new one on every tool call
- The agent rate limiter forgets idle callers instead of growing for the lifetime of the process
- Saved connections are written so only the owner can read them, and a save that fails part way leaves the previous file intact
- Query plans use the connected engine's own EXPLAIN form, and engines without a query plan statement say so instead of failing on malformed SQL
- Reading a query plan through an agent no longer requires write access, while EXPLAIN ANALYZE stays governed as the write it performs
- Agent CSV export quotes values containing separators, quotation marks, or line breaks instead of producing corrupt rows
- Renaming a column in the structure editor applies the rename instead of failing, and the column's other edits apply to the new name
- PostgreSQL foreign key ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions are reported as they are defined instead of always reading as NO ACTION
- Integer cells wider than 2^53 keep their exact value when edited instead of being rounded
- CSV export is limited to the loaded filtered page instead of silently paging an unordered changing table
- ClickHouse integration tests connect over plain HTTP instead of default VerifyFull HTTPS
- Flatpak CI bootstraps Rust 1.93 via rustup so the GNOME 47 SDK's older rust-stable extension is not required
- MCP write preview and other `begin()` paths now run statements through PolicyGuard instead of a raw driver transaction
- Agents are denied (and humans must approve) when a blast-radius estimate cannot be computed for UPDATE/DELETE
- Read-only connections deny unparseable SQL before any human approval fallback
- Activity termination accepts only validated positive numeric session identifiers
- Partial environment and connection policies inherit secure environment defaults and default masking rules
- Transactional batches request approval once instead of once per statement
- Mixed SQL batches retain DDL and unscoped UPDATE or DELETE restrictions regardless of statement order
- The agent daemon requires at least one existing saved connection when issuing a token
- Verified legacy audit journals rotate intact when upgrading to durable intent and outcome records
- PostgreSQL cancellation now stops the server query, records a terminal audit outcome, supports parameterized operations and transaction rollback, and discards sessions with unknown outcomes
- Approval dialogs attach to a visible application window when the desktop does not report an active window
- Saved connections expose a keyboard and screen-reader accessible open action

### Removed

- Unused `Approve for session` approval outcome (no session-grant store existed)
- Broken stdio-under-systemd agentd unit and generated Python bytecode tracked in the repository
- MCP `search_query_history` until history can be connection-isolated, redacted, rate-limited, and audited

### Security

- The headless agent daemon opens a saved connection through its configured SSH chain and verifies the certificate against the real database hostname, instead of dialling the database directly
- MongoDB connections honour the selected TLS mode and certificate authority instead of always connecting without encryption
- MySQL Verify Ca connections no longer crash the application
- ClickHouse connections distinguish encrypt-only from verifying TLS and can name a certificate authority, instead of always verifying against the bundled roots
- Redis connections can use TLS, including a named certificate authority, instead of failing whenever encryption is selected
- MongoDB and Redis connection attempts stop after five seconds instead of waiting on library defaults
- SSH tunnels stop waiting on a host that accepts a connection and never answers, reporting which host and port timed out
- MySQL server-control functions and SQL Server extended and system procedures are recognised as administrative, so agents are denied them the same way they are on PostgreSQL
- Agent write-scope checks classify SQL with the connected engine's dialect instead of always assuming PostgreSQL
- MCP HTTP rejects untrusted browser origins before JSON-RPC dispatch
- SSH host-key changes across key algorithms are treated as mismatches instead of first use
- Linux GitHub Actions are pinned to immutable commits
- TLS certificate verification modes (VerifyCa / VerifyFull) replace encrypt-only Require
- Agent results masked for sensitive column name patterns by default
- MCP tokens with an empty connection allowlist can no longer touch any connection
- SSH stack upgraded to russh 0.60.3 (fixes unbounded allocation advisories and drops vulnerable libcrux 0.0.4)
- Translation locale initialization runs before worker threads and uses the corrected gettext safety contract
- Production GUI and daemon paths no longer construct automatic approval sinks
- Mutations, DDL, administration, and transaction completion persist durable audit intent before database execution and fail closed when required records cannot be written
- Unknown or interrupted write outcomes block later governed writes across restarts and concurrent app and daemon processes
- The audit journal enforces private file permissions, verifies its hash chain, recovers interrupted appends, and serializes writers across processes
- Agentd and in-app MCP refuse service when required audit storage is unavailable
- PostgreSQL administrative and side-effecting function calls are denied to agents and read-only connections while literals and comments remain read-only
- Agent result masking also matches a sensitive column reached through an alias, a wrapping expression, or a subquery, instead of only the result set's reported column name
- A policy pattern the operator adds is applied on top of the built-in sensitive-column patterns instead of replacing them, and an unparseable mask pattern refuses to load instead of silently matching nothing
- An SSH jump hop configured for password authentication is refused instead of silently authenticating with the first hop's password
- ClickHouse identifier quoting escapes a backslash, so a table or column name reported by the server cannot break out of its quoted identifier
- Query history is stored at 0600, including its WAL and SHM files, instead of the filesystem default, so another local account cannot read past statement text
- The headless agent daemon's terminal approval prompt strips control characters from the displayed SQL and rule/reason text instead of writing them to the terminal as-is, and denies an unanswered prompt after two minutes instead of blocking every later tool call indefinitely
- Blast-radius limits now cover INSERT the same way they already covered UPDATE and DELETE, and an UPDATE/DELETE's JOIN, USING, or FROM clause is included in the affected-row estimate instead of being silently dropped
- The administrative-function list denies more PostgreSQL host-access and dblink calls (pg_file_write, pg_file_unlink, dblink_open, dblink_fetch, dblink_connect_u, pg_stat_statements_reset), and SQLite's fileio and extension-loading functions (writefile, readfile, load_extension) are recognised as administrative for the first time
- The MCP execute_query tool refuses a statement that writes instead of committing it directly, so a write can no longer skip execute_write's preview-by-default workflow
- MySQL connections tunnelled through SSH verify Verify Ca and Verify Full against the real database hostname instead of the local tunnel endpoint, matching how PostgreSQL already worked
- Saving a Browse tab edit made before a Structure tab dropped or reordered a column now shows a clear "reload and reapply" error instead of crashing the whole application
- Two windows can no longer open the same saved connection at once; the second is refused with a toast instead of silently taking over the first window's live connection
- Closing a secondary window now closes its database connection, SSH tunnel, and reconnect monitor, and cancels its health-poll and history-prune timers, instead of leaving them running for the rest of the process
- GRANT, REVOKE, COPY, MERGE, and CREATE FUNCTION now name the table or object they target in the audit trail and approval dialog instead of showing a blank object list
- A misspelled policy.toml environment or field name, or a connection override keyed by a UUID typed in a different case, now refuses to load instead of the override silently never applying
- The MCP tools/list method requires the same token tools/call already does, instead of disclosing the full tool catalogue to any caller that can reach the listener
- The MCP stdio server recovers from a non-UTF-8 line the same way it already does from invalid JSON, instead of ending the whole session
- Repeated failed MCP authentication attempts are rate limited even when every attempt uses a different token string
- The MCP HTTP transport now enforces the same request-size limit the stdio transport already did, instead of a larger framework default
